# Kaggle-G2NET-Competition
As a Competitor:
* Built a model with TensorFlow to assess simulated Gravitational Wave (GW) time-series data from an Earth-based detector network.
* Applied fourier transformation to transform the 1-D GW time series data to a 2-D frequency-domain data.
* Constructed a CQT kernel and utilized mixed precision training to shorten the training time.
* Achieved an accuracy of GW detection of 87.8%, which ranked top 5% among 1000+ competing teams.
